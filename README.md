## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Node.js and npm installed
- .NET Core SDK installed
- SQL Server or any other database supported by EF Core
- Docker (optional, for containerization)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/OneSAHDEVSINH/AngularCrudAppWithDotNetCoreEFCore.git

    ```

2. Navigate to the `ClientApp` directory and install the Angular dependencies:

    ```bash
    cd ClientApp
    npm install
    ```

3. Navigate back to the root directory and restore the .NET Core dependencies:
